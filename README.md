# design-pattern-java

This Java Maven project contains several main modules.

Each main module represents a design pattern category (structural, creational, behavioral, other).

Each main module contains several tutorials.

The code of each tutorial corresponds to the various examples, taken initially from the website tutorialspoint and other sites, and customized for interventions on my projects.
